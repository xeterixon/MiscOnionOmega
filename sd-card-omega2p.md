#Getting the SD-Card to work on Omega2+
Get a firmware that supports it from http://repo.onion.io/omega2/images/
Note that the Omega2+ firmawares are named something like "omega2p-".
I used "omega2p-v0.1.8-b145.bin"

Log int to the Omega with ssh or use the terminal from the Omega web.
Download the firmware to the /tmp folder

` cd /tmp `

` wget http://repo.onion.io/omega2/images/omega2p-v0.1.8-b145.bin `
